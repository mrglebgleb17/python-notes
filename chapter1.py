#the print command can print whatever you put in it as long as its in "quotes". this data is known as strings
print("quotes")
#variables can store data in them, and that data can be changed and added to another variable(like in math!)
a=1
b=2
c=a+b
#you can print variables as long as they are not in quotes
print(c)#prints the value of c (which is 3)
print("c")#prints the letter c
#you can print variables and strings in the same print statement & seperated by a comma
print("1+2 is",c)
#in variabes,you can store many different data types
#string
a="strings"
#integer
b=5
#float(decimals)
c=2.71
#boolean  True or False(the first letter MUST be capitalized)
d=True
print(a,b,c,d)
#just like how you can combine 1 and 1 to get 2,you can combine multiple strings!
#ex:
b=" and more strings "
c=a+b
print(c)
