#inputs 3.1
#"inputs" are things YOU can typrn into a variable and decide what it is
#example:

print("you are",a,"years old")

#formatting
# in formatting there are two main functions, type functions and format functions
#format functions turn one type of data into another(flt,int,str,bool)
#example
a="32"
#"a" is a string
b=int(a)
print(a,b)
#the output was the same
#type functions can check what data type a variable is
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
