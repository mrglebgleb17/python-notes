operations 2.1
Operators are things that make binary decisions in python with two inputs
operations are performed with the use of keywords like "and","or" and "not"

AND operation 2.2
the and operation only outputs True if both the inputs are true"""
a=True
b=False
print(a and a)
print(a and b)
#OR operation 2.3
#if one of the inputs is true,the output is true
print(a or b)
print(b or b)
#NOT operation 2.4
#this reverses the input so if the input is true,the output is false and vice-versa
print(not a)
